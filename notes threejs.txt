Changes to colors or verts need update = true
An object is combined arrays of: position, normal, color, uv

GEOMETRY:
UVs = XYs for textures to vertexes mapping
Normals: Vectors for lighting.  face==boxy vector==rounded look
Quaternion: Curved rotation vector
Basic shapes: box, plane, sphere, cylinder
Parametric - good for graphs. Geometry is created from function?
Displacement map - alters vectors from grayscale image

MATERIALS:
You can add a shader as a material.  Shader effect is limited to chosen faces.
Phong - shiny
Lambert - matte
Sprite - image always facing camera
others
